# MCU Collection

In the process of learning about JSON collections, I decided to put my skills to practice by creating a site with a collection of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) content. As a fan of MCU, I thought it would be helpful if I used JSON collections to essentially display all of the films and series with their respective information, categorized by phases and ordered by release date. This is definitely something I could have used myself when I first started getting into MCU!
